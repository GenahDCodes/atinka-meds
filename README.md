# Pharmacy Inventory Management System

A terminal-based Java application for managing pharmacy inventory, suppliers, customers, and transactions. Implements custom data structures and algorithms, and persists data using file I/O.

## Project Structure

- `models/` - Data representation classes (Drug, Supplier, Customer, Transaction, Sale)
- `services/` - Business logic and operations (DrugService, SupplierService, etc.)
- `utils/` - Helper utilities (search, sort, validation, date)
- `ui/` - CLI menu and input handling
- `Main.java` - Entry point

No external libraries. All algorithms and data structures are implemented manually.
